### O Diamond, Diamond, thou little knowest the mischief thou hast done.

![Damn You Diamond](diamond_fire.jpg?raw=true "Damn You Diamond!")

[(Diamond was Newton's mischievous dog)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_(dog))


## What is Diamond?
Diamond utilizes iterative, quasi-Newton 2nd-order solvers for certain kinds of generalized linear  models (GLMs) with arbitrary but known L2-regularization. A common use is fitting mixed-effects models, with their covariance already being known by another means (e.g. lme4). These 2nd-order iterative solvers are considerably faster than a full-blown solution. 

## Limitations
* The random-effects covariances must be input a-priori. Unlike [R's lme4](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/lme4.pdf) or [Julia's MixedModels](https://github.com/dmbates/MixedModels.jl), Diamond does not estimate the covariance of random effects terms. 
* Diamond only supports the following models
	* logistic regression
	* ordinal logistic regression using proportional odds, as defined in Section 7.2.1 of Categorical Data Analysis, 2nd Ed., by Alan Agresti
* Currently, only formulae with crossed, independent random effects are supported. Using the mtcars dataset as an example, these look like `mpg ~ 1 + hp + (1 + hp | cyl) + (1 | gear)`. I.e. no hierarchical terms

## Installation
You must have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) installed. Then, run
`docker run -ti --rm -p 8888:8888 tsweetser/diamond`

Copy-paste the URL, including the token, into your browser. Then, check out the Jupyter notebook examples!

You can also install from PyPI via `pip install sf-diamond`

## Troubleshooting installation
* You may need to restart docker if you've been running jupyter notebooks locally on port 8888.
